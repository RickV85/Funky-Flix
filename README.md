# Funky Flix
## Overview of Project 
### Description

This was a two week, partner project assigned to students in Mod 3 of the Turing School of Software & Design's Front-End Engineering bootcamp. Our goal was to create a user-friendly application that displays all the movies in our collection along with their Funky Flix rating. The purpose of our application is to assist users in determining if a movie is worth watching by providing them with information about each movie.

Our functionality was inspired by popular movie review websites like Rotten Tomatoes, and provides a comprehensive browsing experience where users can sort how the movies are displayed or search for a particular movie by name. By clicking on a movie, users are redirected to that movie's page, which includes the movie's trailer and additional details about the movie that may be of interest to the user, such as the movie's duration and genre.

This project served as a valuable learning opportunity for us, as it was our first project that incorporated React, Cypress testing, and a multi-page user experience using the React Router. You can find the project spec [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html). 

### Goals
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Technologies Used:
- React 
- Router
- Cypress
- REST API
- Webpack
- moment.js

## Installation Instructions:

### Run the application locally using Webapck
- In your terminal, clone this repository to your local machine and CD into the directory. 
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

## Reflection
### Challenges
- Refactoring with Router and incorporating API requests
- Working with React lifecycle methods and understanding the re-rendering process

### Wins
- Received a 100% accessibility score from the Lighthouse Accessibility Audit
- Refactored class based components to functional with hooks
- Implemented sorting and searching functions for all available movies
- Created a responsive layout that supports all screen widths

### Future Considerations
- Adding a login functionality and allowing users to post their own movie ratings
- Allow users to post comments/reviews for movies
