# Funky Flix
## Overview of Project 
### Description
This was a two week, partner project assigned to students in Mod 3 of the Turing School of Software & Design's Front-End Engineering bootcamp. Our goal was to create a user-friendly application that displays all the movies in our collection along with their Funky Flix rating. The purpose of our application is to assist users in determining if a movie is worth watching by providing them with information about each movie. Our design was inspired by popular movie review websites like Rotten Tomatoes, and provides a comprehensive browsing experience where users can sort how the movies are displayed or search for a particular movie by name. By clicking on a particular movie, users are redirected to that movie's page, which includes the movie's trailer and additional details about the movie that may be of interest to the user, such as the movie's duration and genre. This project served as a valuable learning opportunity for us and was our first project that incorporated React, Cypress testing, and a multi-page user experience using the React Router. You can find the project spec [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html). 

### Goals
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Technologies Used:
- React 
- Router
- Cypress
- REST API
- Webpack

## Installation Instructions:

### Run the application locally using Webapck
- In your terminal, clone this repository to your local machine and CD into the directory. 
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to get a local host URL. 
- Copy the local host URL given and paste it in your browswer to view the website.
- To stop the local server from running in your terminal use `command + c`.

## Reflection

### Future Considerations
- If I had time, I would have liked to add a current trip page for any trips that span the current date. I would want this page to display the trip, suggest activities, and allow the user to create an agenda for each day. If a user did not have a current trip, then this page could display a countdown to show the number of days until their next trip. If there are no upcoming trip, then it would display a message encouraging the user to book a trip.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
